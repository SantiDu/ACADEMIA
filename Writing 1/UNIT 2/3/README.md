FEEDBACK:  
This could use some work, namely specifics to fill out the outline. You have a good hook (10) and counterargument (8), but your lens and subject sections are light on details and evidence (7 each), and you don't have anything substantive for the Lens + subject or conclusion sections (0 each). Some proofreading (4 for professionalism).
