FEEDBACK:  
This was a fantastic paper. It showed your in-depth knowledge of the Subject and Lens texts and your ability to provide critical analysis for your chosen thesis. Your paper, overall, was wonderfully written and had strong organization. You have good evidence, with some room to develop additional points in your counterargument (29). Overall, though, a very strong paper.
