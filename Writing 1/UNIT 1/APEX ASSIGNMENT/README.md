FEEDBACK:   
Great work here. A strong opening, good textual evidence, and an insightful analysis. What would be good is to have more of the analysis, since a lot of the paper feels like the introduction setting the reader up for what is to come and, by comparison, the analysis feels a little short. But overall, you should be pleased with a strong first essay here. Well done.
