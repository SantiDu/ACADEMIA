You have a start here. You have an interesting opening, albeit one that could use a little cleaning up with proofreading. The thesis itself is also a little wordy and could be stronger to get your point across (7). You have 2 potential creative elements here. What this does need to really outline the paper is more evidence and specificity, both in the main argument (2) and in the 1 of 2 counterarguments you present (2). A bit light on details that would make this all that it can be to outline the paper.
