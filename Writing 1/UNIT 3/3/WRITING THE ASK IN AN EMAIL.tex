\noindent Dear Professor Issac,
\\[2\baselineskip]
My name is Jinrui Du. I am a masters student studying statistics and data science at Leiden university. My research interest is in describing neural activities with high-dimensional statistical inference. I would appreciate the chance to discuss with you about the PhD opportunity in you research group.

Before the graduate study, I was a software engineer who developed a package that is used by P\&G in more than seven countries. I also have solid experiences implementing data structures and algorithms in C++. This is the final semester of my masters. Our team has been working on a paper that discusses causal inference for high-dimensional data. The paper was accepted by the Biometrika journal. I know that you are hiring researchers with strong programming skills to study the ways of doing causal inference for brain data and I would be a great candidate.

If you are interested, perhaps find the attached CV and we could set up a meeting for interview. Looking forward to hear from you!
